# Prediction-of-Credit-Card-fraud

## Problem Statement:
A credit card is one of the most used financial products to make online purchases and payments. Though the Credit cards can be a convenient way to manage your finances, they can also be risky. Credit card fraud is the unauthorized use of someone else's credit card or credit card information to make purchases or withdraw cash.
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. 

## Dataset
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
We have to build a classification model to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.

### Tasks/Activities List 
Your code should contain the following activities/Analysis: 
-	Collect the time series data from the CSV file linked here. 
-	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Show the Data quality check, treat the missing values, outliers etc if any. 
-	Get the correct datatype for date. 
-	Balancing the data.
-	Feature Engineering and feature selection. 
-	Train/Test Split - Apply a sampling distribution to find the best split. 
-	Choose the metrics for the model evaluation 
-	Model Selection, Training, Predicting and Assessment 
-	Hyperparameter Tuning/Model Improvement 
- Model deployment plan. 

## Getting started
1. get the code from the repository
2. git clone https://github.com/PratikBhirud/Prediction-of-Credit-Card-fraud.git
3. download the dataset that will be used to train a transaction classifier. Unzip it and put the content creditcard.csv under main folder (FindDefault)
4. install required python packages if previously not installed
5. Finally run on Jupyter Notebook
